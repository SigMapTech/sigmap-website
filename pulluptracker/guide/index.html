        <!-- Getting Started -->
        <section id="getting-started" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Getting Started</h2>
          <p>When you first open Pull-Up Tracker, a short onboarding walks you through the basics. You can set a daily goal right away or skip it and configure one later in Settings.</p>
          <p>The app has four tabs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Home</strong> &mdash; Today's stats, a 7-day chart, and your most recent entries</li>
            <li><strong>Stats</strong> &mdash; Detailed statistics by week, month, year, or all time</li>
            <li><strong>Records</strong> &mdash; Your personal bests and streaks</li>
            <li><strong>History</strong> &mdash; Every entry you've logged, grouped by date, plus a Recently Deleted section</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button on the Home tab to log your first set.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Logging Pull-Ups -->
        <section id="logging" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Logging Pull-Ups</h2>
          <p>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to open the entry sheet. You can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Set reps</strong> &mdash; Use the stepper or tap the number to type directly</li>
            <li><strong>Choose a workout type</strong> &mdash; Normal, Weighted, Assisted, or Other</li>
            <li><strong>Add weight</strong> &mdash; Appears for Weighted and Assisted types, in kg or lbs (set in Settings)</li>
            <li><strong>Add notes</strong> &mdash; Optional free-text for extra context</li>
            <li><strong>Change the date</strong> &mdash; Log a past workout by adjusting the date picker</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your default reps and workout type are saved so logging is fast. Change the defaults in Settings.</p>

          <h3>Editing &amp; Deleting</h3>
          <p>Tap any entry in the recent list on the Home tab to edit it. To delete an entry, open it and tap Delete. A confirmation dialog appears before anything is removed.</p>
          <p>Deleted entries are kept for 30 days before permanent removal. You can find and restore them from the <strong>Recently Deleted</strong> section at the bottom of the History tab &mdash; just swipe left on an entry and tap Restore.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Goals -->
        <section id="goals" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Goals</h2>
          <p>Set daily and weekly pull-up goals in Settings. When a goal is active:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>progress ring</strong> shows your daily goal completion on the Home tab</li>
            <li>A <strong>progress bar</strong> tracks your weekly goal below the chart</li>
            <li>Widgets display your goal progress too</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Set a goal to 0 to disable it. Goals sync across your devices via iCloud.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Statistics -->
        <section id="statistics" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Statistics</h2>
          <p>The Stats tab shows detailed breakdowns for any time period:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Week</strong> &mdash; Daily totals for the selected week</li>
            <li><strong>Month</strong> &mdash; Daily totals for the selected month</li>
            <li><strong>Year</strong> &mdash; Monthly totals for the selected year</li>
            <li><strong>All Time</strong> &mdash; Your complete history (monthly or yearly chart depending on data range)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use the <strong>arrow buttons</strong> to navigate between periods. Each view includes comparisons to the previous period so you can see your progress.</p>
          <p>Tap a bar on any chart to see the exact count for that day, month, or year.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Personal Records -->
        <section id="records" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Personal Records</h2>
          <p>The Records tab automatically tracks your best performances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Max reps in a single set</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Best daily total</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Current and longest streaks</strong> &mdash; Streaks allow 1 rest day without breaking</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted records</strong> &mdash; Tracked separately from bodyweight sets</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- History -->
        <section id="history" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">History</h2>
          <p>The History tab shows every entry you've ever logged, organized by year, month, and day. Tap a day to see individual entries. This is also where you can find and edit older entries.</p>
          <h3>Recently Deleted</h3>
          <p>At the bottom of the History tab you'll find a <strong>Recently Deleted</strong> section. Tap the header to expand it and see entries you've deleted in the last 30 days, along with a countdown showing how many days remain before each entry is permanently removed. Swipe left on any entry and tap <strong>Restore</strong> to bring it back.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Widgets -->
        <section id="widgets" class="guide-section fade-in">

        <!-- iCloud Sync -->
        <section id="sync" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">iCloud Sync</h2>
          <p>Your entries sync automatically across all your devices using iCloud. Settings like goals, default reps, and appearance also sync.</p>
          <p>Sync requires:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>iCloud enabled on your device (Settings &rarr; Apple Account &rarr; iCloud)</li>
            <li>The app signed in to the same Apple Account on all devices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Notification preferences are device-specific and do not sync, so you can have different notification settings on your iPhone and iPad.</p>
          <p>To stop syncing, disable iCloud for Pull-Up Tracker in your device's iCloud settings. Your local data will remain on the device.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Notifications -->
        <section id="notifications" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Notifications</h2>
          <p>Enable notifications in Settings to receive progress summaries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Weekly notification</strong> &mdash; Arrives on the first day of your locale's week (e.g., Sunday in the US, Monday in Europe) at 10 AM with your weekly stats</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly notification</strong> &mdash; Arrives on the 1st of each month at 9 AM with your previous month's summary</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Tapping a notification opens the corresponding report in the app. A single toggle controls both notifications.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Siri Shortcuts -->
        <section id="siri" class="guide-section fade-in">

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <section id="faq" class="guide-section fade-in">
          <h2 class="guide-section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I change the weight unit?</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings and change the weight unit between kilograms and pounds. Existing entries will display in the new unit.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I log workouts for past dates?</h3>
            <p>Yes. When adding an entry, tap the date field to pick a different date.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>I accidentally deleted an entry. Can I recover it?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Go to the History tab and look for the <strong>Recently Deleted</strong> section at the bottom. Tap to expand it, then swipe left on the entry you want to recover and tap <strong>Restore</strong>. Deleted entries are kept for 30 days before permanent removal.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do streaks work?</h3>
            <p>A streak counts consecutive days with at least one entry. You get a 1-day grace period &mdash; taking a single rest day won't break your streak.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why isn't my widget updating?</h3>
            <p>Widgets update shortly after you log an entry. iOS limits how often widgets can refresh to save battery. If your widget seems stuck, try removing and re-adding it. Make sure the app isn't force-quit, as background updates won't work in that state.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>My data isn't syncing between devices.</h3>
            <p>Check that iCloud is enabled for Pull-Up Tracker on both devices (Settings &rarr; Apple Account &rarr; iCloud &rarr; Apps Using iCloud). Both devices must be signed into the same Apple Account. Sync can take a few moments, especially on the first launch.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I switch between light and dark mode?</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings and choose System, Light, or Dark under Appearance. System follows your device setting.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Your data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no third-party services. Read the full <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
